# netflix-clone

This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up. The sign in will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, we will use Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database. I built this app using React and uses Styled Components for all the styling we implement.I used Fuse.js for live search and react router for navigation
